    "Bare bones lesson on getting comfortable with pandas. This is designed to highlight some of the primary differences and advantages between pandas and some other tools like SQL, but to also provide a preview of the package so novices can have a better understanding of when they might want to use it within their work.\n",

    "\n",

Because I've imported pandas as `pd`, I need to say `pd.` before all functions that I call from that library.  Meanwhile, this function will return bacx a dataframe object that we will need to save into memory.  The variable name ususally used for this is `df` (dataframe, you see it right?)"
